    "That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. \n" +
    "Pennies saved one and two at a time by\n" +
    "bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher\n" +
    "until one's cheek burned with the silent imputation of parsimony\n" +
    "that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it.\n" +
    "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be\n" +
    "Christmas.\n" +
    "There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the\n" +
    "shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the\n" +
    "moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles,\n" +
    "with sniffles predominating.\n" +
    "While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the\n" +
    "first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat\n" +
    "at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly\n" +
    "had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.\n" +
    "In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter\n" +
    "would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger\n" +
    "could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing\n" +
    "the name 'Mr. James Dillingham Young.'\n" +
    "The 'Dillingham' had been flung to the breeze during a former\n" +
    "period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per\n" +
    "week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of\n" +
    "'Dillingham' looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously\n" +
    "of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever\n" +
    "Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat\n" +
    "above he was called 'Jim' and greatly hugged by Mrs. James\n" +
    "Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is\n" +
    "all very good.\n" +
    "Delia finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the\n" +
    "powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a\n" +
    "grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow\n" +
    "would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to\n" +
    "buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for\n" +
    "months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far.\n" +
    "Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always\n" +
    "are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy\n" +
    "hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something\n" +
    "fine and rare and sterling - something just a little bit near to\n" +
    "being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.\n" +
    "There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps\n" +
    "you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very\n" +
    "agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence\n" +
    "of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his\n" +
    "looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\n" +
    "Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the\n" +
    "glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its\n" +
    "colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair\n" +
    "and let it fall to its full length.\n" +
    "Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham\n" +
    "Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold\n" +
    "watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other\n" +
    "was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the\n" +
    "airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some\n" +
    "day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had\n" +
    "King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the\n" +
    "basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he\n" +
    "passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\n" +
    "So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining\n" +
    "like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and\n" +
    "made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again\n" +
    "nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood\n" +
    "still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\n" +
    "On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat.\n" +
    "With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her\n" +
    "eyes, she fluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the\n" +
    "street.\n" +
    "Where she stopped the sign read: 'Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods\n" +
    "of All Kinds.' One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting.\n" +
    "Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the 'Sofronie.'\n" +
    "'Will you buy my hair?' asked Della.\n" +
    "'I buy hair,' said Madame. 'Take yer hat off and let's have a\n" +
    "sight at the looks of it.'\n" +
    "Down rippled the brown cascade.\n" +
    "'Twenty dollars,' said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised\n" +
    "hand.\n" +
    "'Give it to me quick,' said Della.\n" +
    "Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget\n" +
    "the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's\n" +
    "present.\n" +
    "She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one\n" +
    "else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had\n" +
    "turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple\n" +
    "and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance\n" +
    "alone and not by meretricious ornamentation - as all good things\n" +
    "should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it\n" +
    "she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and\n" +
    "value - the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they\n" +
    "took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents.\n" +
    "With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about\n" +
    "the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes\n" +
    "looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he\n" +
    "used in place of a chain.\n" +
    "When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to\n" +
    "prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the\n" +
    "gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity\n" +
    "added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends - a\n" +
    "mammoth task.\n" +
    "Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, closelying\n" +
    "curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.\n" +
    "She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and\n" +
    "critically.\n" +
    "'If Jim doesn't kill me,' she said to herself, 'before he takes a\n" +
    "second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl.\n" +
    "But what could I do - oh! what could I do with a dollar and\n" +
    "eighty-seven cents?'\n" +
    "At seven o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on\n" +
    "the back of the stove, hot and ready to cook the chops.\n" +
    "Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and\n" +
    "sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered.\n" +
    "Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight,\n" +
    "and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying\n" +
    "little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now\n" +
    "she whispered: 'Please God, make him think I am still pretty.'\n" +
    "The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked\n" +
    "thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two - and\n" +
    "to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he\n" +
    "was without gloves.\n" +
    "Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the\n" +
    "scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an\n" +
    "expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It\n" +
    "was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any\n" +
    "of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared\n" +
    "at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\n" +
    "Della wriggled off the table and went for him.\n" +
    "'Jim, darling,' she cried, 'don't look at me that way. I had my\n" +
    "hair cut off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through\n" +
    "Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again - you\n" +
    "won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully\n" +
    "fast. Say \"Merry Christmas!\" Jim, and let's be happy. You don't\n" +
    "know what a nice - what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you.'\n" +
    "'You've cut off your hair?' asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had\n" +
    "not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental\n" +
    "labour.\n" +
    "'Cut it off and sold it,' said Della. 'Don't you like me just as\n" +
    "well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?'\n" +
    "Jim looked about the room curiously.\n" +
    "'You say your hair is gone?' he said with an air almost of idiocy.\n" +
    "'You needn't look for it,' said Della. 'It's sold, I tell you - sold\n" +
    "and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went\n" +
    "for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,' she went on\n" +
    "with a sudden serious sweetness, 'but nobody could ever count my\n" +
    "love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?'\n" +
    "Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his\n" +
    "Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some\n" +
    "inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week\n" +
    "or a million a year - what is the difference? A mathematician or a\n" +
    "wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable\n" +
    "gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be\n" +
    "illuminated later on.\n" +
    "Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon\n" +
    "the table.\n" +
    "'Don't make any mistake, Dell,' he said, 'about me. I don't think\n" +
    "there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo\n" +
    "that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that\n" +
    "package you may see why you had me going awhile at first.'\n" +
    "White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then\n" +
    "an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to\n" +
    "hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment\n" +
    "of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n" +
    "O HENRY - 100 SELECTED STORIES 5\n" +
    "For there lay The Combs - the set of combs, side and back, that\n" +
    "Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful\n" +
    "combs, pure tortoiseshell, with jewelled rims - just the shade to\n" +
    "wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs,\n" +
    "she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them\n" +
    "without the least hope of possession. And now they were hers, but\n" +
    "the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were\n" +
    "gone.\n" +
    "But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able\n" +
    "to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: 'My hair grows so\n" +
    "fast, Jim!'\n" +
    "And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, 'Oh,\n" +
    "oh!'\n" +
    "Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to\n" +
    "him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed\n" +
    "to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n" +
    "'Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll\n" +
    "have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your\n" +
    "watch. I want to see how it looks on it.'\n" +
    "Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his\n" +
    "hands under the back of his head and smiled.\n" +
    "'Dell,' said he, 'let's put our Christmas presents away and keep\n" +
    "'em awhile. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the\n" +
    "watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you\n" +
    "put the chops on.'\n" +
    "The magi, as you know, were wise men - wonderfully wise men\n" +
